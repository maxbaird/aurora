# aurora

Aurora is a demonstration of a room booking application. It is important to note
that the primary purpose of this application is to test building applications
for the Raspberry Pi and it is not intended for real world use. There are also
currently no plans to make it ready for real-world use. For these reasons a
serious attempt was not made to properly work on Aurora's software architecture
and/or code quality and no tests have been written. However, both of the
aforementioned may be addressed at a later date.
